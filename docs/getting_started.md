# Getting Started

To Quickly start testing our services,you can use our [Sandbox!](https://docs.mimepost.com/sandbox/).

## Step 1: Add your sender domain

You need to add and update the required DNS configuration for the sender domain which you are planning to use for sending emails. Example; if you are planning to send emails using care@mydomain.com, then first you need to add mydomain.com and update the DNS settings.

## Step 2: Sender domain review

Post the domain is added and the required DNS settings are done, our compliance team is going to review your domain. This process might take 24-48 hours. You will be receiving a email once the domain is approved and ready for sending emails.

## Step 3: Start sending emails

Once the domain is approved, you are all set to send emails.

You can send email using [SMTP!](https://docs.mimepost.com/smtp/) or [HTTP API!](https://docs.mimepost.com/api/)
