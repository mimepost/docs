Sandbox allows you to quickly test our services. In order to use it, you will first need to add your email to Sandbox. Then you can use our SMTP or API to send test emails on the added email. It works even without adding your domain.

Below are the simple steps to use Sandbox

## Step 1: Add your valid email address to Sandbox

1. Log into your MimePost's account

2. On left hand menu, click menu "Sandbox"

3. Click on Add Email button

4. Provide your valid email address and click on "Add Email" button.


## Step 2: Verify your sandbox email address

1. Check your email for our verification email and copy that the code.

2. From the list of sandbox emails, click on Verify link

3. Provide the verification code and click on "Verify Your Email" button

4. On successful verification it will show a success message and redirect you to the sandbox email list page. Now, your email address status will be showed as verified (in green color).

Congratulations! You have added your first email to your MimePost's Sandbox. Now you can send email on this email address using MimePost SMTP or HTTP API. You even do not need to verify domain to send your emails on this email. This way you can quickly test our service and even start integrating our service with your application while your domain will be under approval process.

You can add maximum 10 emails addresses to the sandbox.
